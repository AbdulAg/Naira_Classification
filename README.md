## Nigerian Naira Classification in Adverse Conditions

# Overview
This project focuses on classifying Nigerian naira denominations under challenging conditions (blur, noise, occlusion), enabling robust currency recognition for automated systems. Led a team to develop and deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, achieving high accuracy in real-world scenarios.

# Features
**Robust Classification:** Utilizes ResNet50 and MobileNetV2-V3 with transfer learning and data augmentation for reliable performance.  
**Real-World Deployment:** Deployed as an interactive web app using Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces for real-time currency classification.  
**Data Handling:** Processes a custom dataset of naira images, organized into Train, Test, and Validation sets, with advanced preprocessing.  

# Technologies
**Deep Learning:** PyTorch, torchvision  
**Deployment:** Gradio, Hugging Face Spaces  
**Data Processing:** pandas, NumPy, OpenCV  
**Environment:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook  

# Usage
Clone the repository: git clone   
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt  
Access the deployed app via [abdulrahmanabdullahi/Naira_Note_Classifier] for real-time testing.  

# Results
Achieved 91% accuracy with MobileNetV3, optimized for efficiency. The deployed app supports real-time classification, handling diverse image conditions.
